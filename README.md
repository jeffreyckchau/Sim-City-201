#Overview

Our project implements multiple residences, a market, a bank, a restaurant, 2 busses and multiple pedestrians utilizing A*, Day and Night system, among other features. 

Within our project, we initially assigned very specific roles for each team member to be responsible for. However, as development progressed, each team member assisted one another in the assignments we were responsible for, so every team member had a hand in every branch of the project. 

The specific initial emphases of each team member were:

Ryan: Transportation, overworld GUI

Jeffrey: Transportation, git-integration

Mike: Person, Roles

Kushaan: Person, Roles

Dylan: Residence and Residence GUI, Restaurant integration

Luca: Market and Market GUI

Byron: Bank and Bank GUI

Additionally, every member helped each other with design, bug-fixing, and J-Unit testing. We believe the work distribution was overall equal between all 7 of us. 

#Execution instructions

The project is best run through the eclipse editor by using the play button to run SimCity201Gui. If the play button does not work, the main application can be run through the src/gui/SimCity201Gui.java file. 


#Known Issues

+ Persons will inconsistently reenter Overworld (it works half the time) from buildings
+ A* leads to clogging of building entrances and may impact machine performance
+ There is currently no delivery truck
+ There exists a framework for both parties and the new Producer/Consumer model waiters, but neither are implemented due to time constraints.
