Within our project, we initially assigned very specific roles for each team member to be responsible for. However, as development progressed, each team member assisted one another in the assignments we were responsible for, so every team member had a hand in every branch of the project. 

The specific initial emphases of each team member were:

Ryan: Transportation, overworld GUI

Jeffrey: Transportation, git-integration

Mike: Person, Roles

Kushaan: Person, Roles

Dylan: Residence and Residence GUI, Restaurant integration

Luca: Market and Market GUI

Byron: Bank and Bank GUI

Additionally, every member helped each other with design, bug-fixing, and J-Unit testing. We believe the work distribution was overall equal between all 7 of us.
